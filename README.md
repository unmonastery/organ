# Documentation of the unMonastery Organ and Deep Time Bank #

As a decentralised membership steered organisation, we needed a criteria for inclusion. We settled upon a membership ‘fee’ of 100 hours of unpaid unMonastery labour as the marker for meaningful commitment, and─we sent out an invite to all those that had contributed this level of time to the initiative up until then. We then got deliciously sidetracked by field level developments in Athens. Now, finally back on track, this <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mvgS5RObf29Htfubh0fY_s7aVkFL1mQb70jNvztuF44/edit?usp=sharing">organisational document</a> should outline how we anticipate the organisational structure will work in practice as both a membership base, organisation forum and commitment management account. We are very <a href="https://medium.com/@unmonastery/unmonastery-the-year-ahead-2f082b000a7a#.bb8gvjvnz">happy to announce the composition</a> of this new organisation of intrepid souls committed to the continuation of the unMonastery initiative.

If at this stage you would like to participate to a greater degree, or have been working in isolation on unMonastery related activity let us know at <a href="mailto:admin@unmonastery.org">admin@unmonastery.org</a>, and time permitting be sworn into the unOrder at the next annual general meeting.

If the model we’ve established is of interest to you and you’d like to help us to refine it further, use it for your own organisation or assist in the development of a complementary technology stack, drop into <a href="http://discourse.unmonastery.org/t/examining-the-unmonastery-deep-time-bank/107">this thread</a> on Discourse.
