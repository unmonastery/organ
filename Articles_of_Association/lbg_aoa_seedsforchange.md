### Calling a directors’ meeting

**11. (1)** Any director may call a directors’ meeting by giving notice
of the meeting to the directors.

**(2)** Notice of any directors’ meeting must indicate:

> **(a)** its proposed date and time;
>
> **(b)** where it is to take place; and
>
> **(c)** if it is anticipated that directors participating in the
> meeting will not be in the same place, how it is proposed that they
> should communicate with each other during the meeting.

**(3)** Notice of a directors’ meeting must be given to each director,
but need not be in writing.

**(4)** Notice of a directors’ meeting need not be given to directors
who waive their entitlement to notice of that meeting, by giving notice
to that effect to the co‑operative not more than 7 days after the date
on which the meeting is held. Where such notice is given after the
meeting has been held, that does not affect the validity of the meeting,
or of any business conducted at it.

### Participation in directors’ meetings

**12. (1)** Subject to the articles, directors participate in a
directors’ meeting, or part of a directors’ meeting, when:

> **(a)** the meeting has been called and takes place in accordance with
> the articles, and
>
> **(b)** they can each communicate to the others any information or
> opinions they have on any particular item of the business of the
> meeting.
>
> **(2)** In determining whether directors are participating in a
> directors’ meeting, it is irrelevant where any director is or how they
> communicate with each other.
>
> **(3)** If all the directors participating in a meeting are not in the
> same place, they may decide that the meeting is to be treated as
> taking place wherever any of them is.

### Quorum for directors’ meetings

**13. (1)** At a directors’ meeting, unless a quorum is participating,
no proposal is to be decided on, except a proposal to call another
meeting.

**(2)** The quorum for directors’ meetings may be fixed from time to
time by a decision of the co‑operative in general meeting, but it must
never be less than 50% of the directors or two, whichever is greater.

**(3)** If the total number of directors for the time being is less than
the two, the directors must not take any decision other than a decision
to call a general meeting so as to enable the members to appoint further
directors.

### Facilitation of directors’ meetings

**14. (1)** The directors may appoint a member to facilitate their
meetings.

**(2)** The person so appointed for the time being is known as the
facilitator.

**(3)** The directors may terminate the facilitator’s appointment at any
time.

within ten minutes of the time at which it was to start, the
participating directors may appoint one of themselves to facilitate it.

### Conflicts of interest

**15. (1)** If a proposed decision of the directors is concerned with an
actual or proposed transaction or arrangement with the co‑operative in
which a director is interested, that director is not to be counted as
participating in that part of the meeting for quorum or decision making
purposes.

**(2)** But if paragraph **(3)** applies, a director who is interested
in an actual or proposed transaction or arrangement with the
co‑operative is to be counted as participating in the decision making
process for quorum and decision making purposes.

**(3)** This paragraph applies when

**(a)** the board decides to disapply the provision of the articles
which would otherwise prevent a director from being counted as
participating in the decision making process;

**(b)** the director’s interest cannot reasonably be regarded as likely
to give rise to a conflict of interest; or

**(c)** the director’s conflict of interest arises from a permitted
cause.

**(4)** For the purposes of this article, the following are permitted
causes

**(a)** a guarantee given, or to be given, by or to a director in
respect of an obligation incurred by or on behalf of the co‑operative or
any of its subsidiaries;

**(b)** subscription, or an agreement to subscribe, for securities of
the co‑operative or any of its subsidiaries, or to underwrite,
sub-underwrite, or guarantee subscription for any such securities; and

**(c)** arrangements pursuant to which benefits are made available to
employees and directors or former employees and directors of the
co‑operative or any of its subsidiaries which do not provide special
benefits for directors or former directors.

**(5)** For the purposes of this article, references to proposed
decisions and decision making processes include any directors’ meeting
or part of a directors’ meeting.

**(6)** If a question arises at a meeting of directors or of a committee
of directors as to the right of a director to participate in the meeting
(or part of the meeting) for decision making or quorum purposes, the
question may, before the conclusion of the meeting, be decided upon by
the board.

### Directors’ discretion to make further rules

**16.** Subject to the articles, the co‑operative in general meeting or
the board of directors may make any rule which they think fit about the
running of the co‑operative.

### Methods of appointing directors

**17. (1)** Only Members of the co‑operative who are permitted by law to
do so may be appointed to be a director. Directors shall be appointed by
decision of a general meeting of members of the co‑operative.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  *Optional: **This clause makes the co‑op collectively managed,** delete this if your co‑op is to elect a board of directors (and then renumber (3) to (2)).*
  **(2)** Subject to any decision of the co‑operative in general meeting, all members of the co‑operative shall also be directors. Upon becoming a member of the co‑operative a person shall be appointed to the board of directors and if a person ceases to hold office as a director they will also cease to be a member of the co‑operative.
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**(3)** This article is entrenched in accordance with section 22 of the
Act and any alteration to the article requires the approval of 100% of
the members.

### Termination of director’s appointment

**18.** A person ceases to be a director as soon as

> **(a)** that person ceases to be a director by virtue of any provision
> of the Companies Act 2006 or is prohibited from being a director by
> law;
>
> **(b)** a composition is made with that person’s creditors generally
> in satisfaction of that person’s debts;
>
> **(c)** a registered medical practitioner who is treating that person
> gives a written opinion to the co‑operative stating that that person
> has become physically or mentally incapable of acting as a director
> and may remain so for more than three months;
>
> **(d)** by reason of that person’s mental health, a court makes an
> order which wholly or partly prevents that person from personally
> exercising any powers or rights which that person would otherwise
> have;
>
> **(e)** notification is received by the co‑operative from the director
> that the director is resigning from office, and such resignation has
> taken effect in accordance with its terms;

documents sent to that director in a particular way are to be deemed to
have been received within a specified time of their being sent, and for

### **Annexe A** (being a part of the Articles of Association of \_\_\_\_\_\_ Ltd)

#### Statement on the Co‑operative Identity

##### Definition

A co‑operative is an autonomous association of persons united
voluntarily to meet their common economic, social, and cultural needs
and aspirations through a jointly-owned and democratically-controlled
enterprise.

##### Values

Co‑operatives are based on the values of self-help, self-responsibility,
democracy, equality, equity and solidarity. In the tradition of their
founders, co‑operative members believe in the ethical values of honesty,
openness, social responsibility and caring for others.

##### Principles

The co‑operative principles are guidelines by which co‑operatives put
their values into practice.

###### 1st Principle: Voluntary and Open Membership

Co‑operatives are voluntary organisations, open to all persons able to
use their services and willing to accept the responsibilities of
membership, without gender, social, racial, political or religious
discrimination.

###### 2nd Principle: Democratic Member Control

Co‑operatives are democratic organisations controlled by their members,
who actively participate in setting their policies and making decisions.
Men and women serving as elected representatives are accountable to the
membership. In primary co‑operatives members have equal voting rights
(one member, one vote) and co‑operatives at other levels are also
organised in a democratic manner.

###### 3rd Principle: Member Economic Participation

Members contribute equitably to, and democratically control, the capital
of their co‑operative. At least part of that capital is usually the
common property of the co‑operative. Members usually receive limited
compensation, if any, on capital subscribed as a condition of
membership. Members allocate surpluses for any or all of the following
purposes: developing their co‑operative, possibly by setting up
reserves, part of which at least would be indivisible; benefiting
members in proportion to their transactions with the co‑operative; and
supporting other activities approved by the membership.

###### \
4th Principle: Autonomy and Independence

Co‑operatives are autonomous, self-help organisations controlled by
their members. If they enter into agreements with other organisations,
including governments, or raise capital from external sources, they do
so on terms that ensure democratic control by their members and maintain
their co‑operative autonomy.

###### 5th Principle: Education, Training and Information

Co‑operatives provide education and training for their members, elected
representatives, managers, and employees so they can contribute
effectively to the development of their co‑operatives. They inform the
general public – particularly young people and opinion leaders – about
the nature and benefits of co‑operation.

###### 6th Principle: Co‑operation among Co‑operatives

Co‑operatives serve their members most effectively and strengthen the
co‑operative movement by working together through local, national,
regional and international structures.

###### 7th Principle: Concern for Community

Co‑operatives work for the sustainable development of their communities
through policies approved by their members.

**Secondary Rules**<span id="__DdeLink__328_9125408971" class="anchor"><span id="__DdeLink__665_18167257153" class="anchor"></span></span> **of \_\_\_\_\_\_ Ltd**
==================================================================================================================================================================

***Notes:** *

*Secondary rules complement your Articles and set out in more detail how
your co‑op will be run. They are not part of the official Articles and
do not get sent to Companies House. They are an internal document and
can easily be changed at a co‑op meeting, without having to notify
Companies House. The sample rules below are the minimum we recommend –
they set out in more detail what is meant by consensus decision-making,
which is quite important in case there is disagreement within the co‑op.
You may wish to add more information about the structure of the co‑op,
who membership is open to, selection and probation processes, employment
and allocation of work, volunteers, more on meetings. What exactly and
how much you include in your Secondary Rules is entirely up to your
co‑op. One example of more detailed secondary rules can be found here:
www.organiclea.org.uk/about/ethics/co‑operative/*

*To use the sample secondary rules below your co‑op should:*

-   *decide whether to have a minimum number of work hours needed to be
    eligible for membership, and to change that number in rule 2);*

-   *decide on a minimum number of people needed for meetings (quoracy).
    The model articles already set a minimum, so you only need to
    include rule 4) and 5) if you decide to have a higher number in the
    secondary rules;*

-   *read the notes on the Articles of Association above.*

### General

1)  These secondary rules are intended to complement and clarify the
    Articles of Association of our co‑operative. They are agreed by
    general meeting of the co‑operative and may be changed at any time
    by a general meeting of the co‑operative.

### Membership

2\) Our Articles allow for a condition of membership to be made on a
minimum number of hours worked. This prescribed number of hours shall be
set at 20 hours per month. (Article 22(1)(b))

### Policies and Procedures

3\) The co‑operative shall have the following policies and procedures:

-   Grievance procedure

-   Disciplinary procedure

-   Equality Policy

-   Ethical Policy

### Meetings

4\) The quorum required for a directors’ meeting shall be 3 directors or
50% of the directors, whichever is greater. (Article 13(2))

5\) The quorum required for a general meeting shall be 3 members or 50%
of the membership, whichever is greater. (Article 28(2))

#### Consensus

6\) This co‑op is committed to making decisions which every member can
support. Consensus is reached if every member present are in agreement
on an issue, or when not in agreement agree not to maintain an
objection.

7\) In order to use consensus members recognise that:

-   They share a common goal for the co‑operative.

-   They are committed to reaching consensus.

-   ![](media/image8.png){width="5.789583333333334in"
    height="7.259027777777778in"}

-   Good decisions need to be given enough time, and rushing a decision
    rarely helps in the long term. As consensus and its underlying
    values of trust, honesty and openness are not generally prac­tised
    in wider society it can take time to adjust and learn to do
    consensus well and efficiently.

-   The running of the co‑operative and its meetings requires the active
    participation of members.

-   In order to reach consensus we need to be clear about the process we
    use so that we understand how we are making the decision.

7\) We generally use the process outlined below to reach consensus.
Although not all decisions need to explicitly use this process any
member may demand that the process below be followed explicitly in each
of its stages.
